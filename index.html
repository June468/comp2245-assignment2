            It is very easy to relate to anime as they display scenarios similar to that of reality and teaches life lessons.
            In the anime Naruto Shippuden, Itachi Uchiha is labeled as a villain. He is portrayed as a traitor to the leaf village who murdered all of his clan members including his family and joined a group called the Akatsuki.
            Even though everyone was led to believe this, Itachi was not a villain. he was basically a loyal worker who followed the orders of his masters, only to be later used as a scapegoat. 
            In reality there are many bosses who take advantage of their worker only to step on them and throw them away. "Use and abuse", is a phrase that many of these bosses adapt to. 
            Itachi shows that sometime the good guy has to become bad in order to show who the true villains are. When an employee expose their employer or the company for what they really are, that employee is the labeled as a whistle blower. 
            In some cases they are portrayed as the bad guy because they showed the truth and, in society that is considered bad.</p>
   
    <p id="data2">I agree with the ideology of the Hero Killer. 
        Chizome Akaguro, or better known as the Hero Killer, is an anime character  who is a villain and former vigilante that is notorious for killing many pro heroes that go against his ideology.
         He believed in creating a society of "true" heroes by getting rid of all the "fake" heroes. 
         These fake heroes were individuals who only did thing for recognition and fame, they never really helped anyone.
          "Both this sham-filled society and the criminals who wield their power in the name of petty mischief". 
            A hero is someone who is willing to help an individual no mater what, yet here these heroes are smiling in front of the camera while others are asking for help.
           This is the same for society, where there are many who don't care about anything or anyone, only the fame and fortune. 
            There are a lot of person who take pictures when helping the poor or doing voluntary work, this include, celebrities', politician, youtubers and more, but the question is asked are they really helping these people or are they just doing it for recognition.
            The sad part is these poverty stricken persons can only just smile because they know that they may not get anything else for a while, so the only options is to take what is given to them.  </p>

    <h2 class="Title">Lessons </h2>
    <p class="info"> September 30, 2023 by June Douglas</p>
    
    <p id="data3">The way reality operates has caused a division amongst persons.
         Can persons be considered  to simply be living in their own world shaped by their beliefs?
          People live their lives bound by what they accept as "correct" and "true", that's how they define reality. 
          However what does it mean to be correct or true? Can it all just be that their concepts of reality may all be a mirage? 
          As stated by Itachi Uchiha from Naruto people only accept what they believe is acceptable.
           Persons are no longer free to express their thoughts on a particular subject matter because it is seen as wrong to do so.
           Humans are hard to please. If someone work as a garbage collectors or construction worker then they don't have a decent job.
            The concept is "if you don't have a job, then you are a bum and if you you have a job but it isn't white color, then your job type isn't satisfactory". 
            This is the way reality is, a concept that has caused a barrier to be formed amongst people.
            These barriers comes in different classification; rich or poor, what is classed as good looking or ugly and, blue color or white color jobs.</p>

        <p id="data4">  Life has a way of teaching us things. 
            "Sometimes you must hurt in order to know, fall in order to grow, lose in order to gain because life's greater lesson are learned through pain", a statement made by Nagato, a character created by Masashi Kishimoto.
            Unless we experience things for our selves one wouldn't know how it actually feels, they can only imagine. 
            Persons won't know how it feels to be starved unless they experience it.
            Persons won't know how it feels to be abused unless they experience it.
            Persons won't know how it feels to be blind unless they experience it. 
            There are many things that aren't known unless we put ourselves in that position.
            When a child falls he or she will do one of two things; get up and dust of themselves or cry.
            There are persons who, in their own minds have suffered all their lives. 
            There are those who use those painful moments as a momentum to push themselves to meet there goals. 
            Then, there are others who are quick to put the blame on anything other than themselves for their suffering, this is how we as humans behave sometimes. 
            A person who experience true happiness is one who has gained a lot through their life lessons. </p>
